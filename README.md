EXECUTIVE SUMMARY of Caostone Project: Penetration testing
TechShield Security Team performed a security assessment of the internal corporate network of ABC Company on August 30,2025. TechShield Security Team’s penetration test simulated an attack from an external threat actor attempting to gain access to systems within the ABC Company’s corporate network. The purpose of this assessment was to discover and identify vulnerabilities in ABC Company’s infrastructure and suggest methods to remediate the vulnerabilities. TechShield Security Team identified a total multiple vulnerabilities within the scope of the engagement which are broken down by severity in the table below.
Risk Analysis
•Critical: 4 (15%)
•High: 8 (30%)
•Medium: 10 (40%)
•Low: 3 (15%)


The highest severity vulnerabilities give potential attackers the opportunity to gain remote shell access to internal systems, brute force user accounts, and exploit outdated applications. This could lead to full compromise of sensitive business data and disruption of core services.
Immediate remediation is advised for the critical and high-risk vulnerabilities, while medium and low risks should be addressed in a phased approach.
HIGH LEVEL ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
Observed Security Strengths

TechShield Security Team identified the following strengths in ABC Company’s network which greatly increases the security of the network. ABC Company should continue to monitor these controls to ensure they remain effective.
Here list out the all strength of the network that you have identified 
●	Proper network segmentation was in place between user laptops and application servers.

●	Logging and monitoring were enabled at the firewall level.

●	Strong password policies were enforced for admin accounts.
Areas for Improvement
TechShield Security Team recommends ABC Company takes the following actions to improve the security of the network. Implementing these recommendations will reduce the likelihood that an attacker will be able to successfully attack ABC Company’s information systems and/or reduce the impact of a successful attack.
Short Term Recommendations 
TechShield Security Team recommends ABC Company take the following actions as soon as possible to minimize business risk. 
●	Patch outdated software (Apache, DVWA instance).

●	Harden firewall rules to limit unnecessary open ports.

●	Implement account lockout policies to mitigate brute-force attempts.
●	Strengthen system-level controls:
●	Implement a password history policy: Prevent users from reusing previous passwords.
●	Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Add another layer of security, so that even if a password is stolen, it cannot be used without a second form of verification.
●	Enforce account lockout policies: Prevent brute-force attacks by locking accounts after a set number of failed login attempts.
●	Regularly reset local admin passwords: Perform this at set intervals for security.

Long Term Recommendations 
TechShield Security Team recommends the following actions be taken over the next 6-12 months to fix hard-to-remediate issues that do not pose an urgent risk to the business.
●	Deploy an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS).

●	Establish continuous vulnerability monitoring using OpenVAS.

●	Conduct periodic VAPT assessments every 6–12 months.

TESTING METHODOLOGY
TechShield Security Team’s testing methodology was split into three phases: Reconnaissance, Target Assessment, and Execution of Vulnerabilities. During reconnaissance, we gathered information about ABC Company’s network systems. TechShield Security Team used port scanning and other enumeration methods to refine target information and assess target values. Next, we conducted our targeted assessment. TechShield Security Team simulated an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in the ABC Company network. TechShield Security Team gathered evidence of vulnerabilities during this phase of the engagement while conducting the simulation in a manner that would not disrupt normal business operations.
ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AND SUGGESTED REMEDIATION 
1. Weak Login Authentication – DVWA
Risk Score: 9 (High)
 Exploitation Likelihood: Likely
 Business Impact: Major
 Remediation Difficulty: Easy
Synopsis:
 Weak login authentication mechanisms in DVWA allowed brute-force attacks using Hydra.
Analysis:
 Using Hydra, weak credentials (admin:password) were successfully discovered. This could allow unauthorized access to the DVWA application.
 
 
Suggested Remediation:
●	Enforce account lockouts after failed attempts.

●	Implement CAPTCHA on login pages.

●	Enforce stronger password policies.

2. Remote Code Execution via Metasploit (Windows Victim Laptop)
Risk Score: 10 (Critical)
 Exploitation Likelihood: Likely
 Business Impact: Major
 Remediation Difficulty: Moderate
Synopsis:
 Exploitable Windows service on the victim laptop allowed remote shell access.
Analysis:
 Metasploit successfully established a Meterpreter session, allowing full system compromise.
 
 
Suggested Remediation:
●	Apply vendor security patches immediately.

●	Disable or firewall vulnerable services.

●	Conduct system hardening and endpoint detection deployment.

3. Outdated Apache Web Server
Risk Score: 6 (Medium)
 Exploitation Likelihood: Possible
 Business Impact: Moderate
 Remediation Difficulty: Easy
Synopsis:
 OpenVAS identified Apache version with multiple CVEs.
Suggested Remediation:
 Upgrade to the latest Apache release and apply all security patches.
 
 
Total CVEs detected on 192.168.57.40

4. Insecure Database Configuration
Risk Score: 5 (Medium)
 Exploitation Likelihood: Possible
 Business Impact: Moderate
 Remediation Difficulty: Moderate
Synopsis:
 PostgreSQL server allowed weak authentication methods and lacked SSL/TLS.
Suggested Remediation:
●	Enforce SSL/TLS encryption.

●	Configure stronger authentication (SCRAM-SHA-256).

●	Restrict access by IP whitelisting.

5. Firewall Rules Not Following Best Practices
Risk Score: 2 (Low)
 Exploitation Likelihood: Unlikely
 Business Impact: Minor
 Remediation Difficulty: Easy
Synopsis:
 Firewall exposed multiple unnecessary open ports detected during Nmap scans.
 
Suggested Remediation:
 Restrict open ports to only business-critical services.
